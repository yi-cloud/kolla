Building Container Images
=========================

Firstly, ensure kolla is installed or ready for development.

Then the :command:`kolla-build` command is responsible for building Docker images.

.. note::

   When developing Kolla it can be useful to build images using files located in
   a local copy of Kolla. Use the ``tools/build.py`` script instead of
   :command:`kolla-build` command in all below instructions.

Generating kolla-build.conf
===========================

Install tox and generate the build configuration. The build configuration is
designed to hold advanced customizations when building images.

If you have already cloned the Kolla Git repository to the ``kolla`` folder,
generate the ``kolla-build.conf`` file using the following steps.

If you don't, you can also run ``kolla-build`` without a ``kolla-build.conf``
or with the file you find in the ``etc_examples`` folder of the Kolla pip package.
But you should only do that for testing purposes, if at all.

.. code-block:: console

   pip install tox
   cd kolla/
   tox -e genconfig

.. end

The location of the generated configuration file is
``etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf``, it can also be copied to ``/etc/kolla``. The
default location is one of ``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` or
``etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf``.

Building kolla images
=====================

In general, images are built like this:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py

.. end

By default, the above command would build all images based on CentOS image.

The operator can change the base distro with the ``-b`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build -b ubuntu

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py -b ubuntu

.. end

There are following distros available for building images:

- centos
- debian
- oraclelinux
- rhel
- ubuntu

.. warning::

   Fedora images are deprecated since Newton and will be removed
   in the future.

It is possible to build only a subset of images by specifying them on the
command line:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build keystone

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py keystone

.. end

In this case, the build script builds all images whose name contains the
``keystone`` string along with their dependencies.

Multiple names may be specified on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build keystone nova

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py keystone nova

.. end

The set of images built can be defined as a profile in the ``profiles`` section
of ``kolla-build.conf``. Later, profile can be specified by ``--profile`` CLI
argument or ``profile`` option in ``kolla-build.conf``. Kolla provides some
pre-defined profiles:

- ``infra`` infrastructure-related images
- ``main`` core OpenStack images
- ``aux`` auxiliary images such as trove, magnum, ironic
- ``default`` minimal set of images for a working deploy

For example, due to Magnum requires Heat, add the following profile to
``profiles`` section in ``kolla-build.conf``:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [profiles]
   magnum = magnum,heat

These images can be built using command line:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build --profile magnum

.. end

Or put following line to ``DEFAULT`` section in ``kolla-build.conf`` file:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [DEFAULT]
   profile = magnum

.. end

The :command:`kolla-build` uses ``kolla`` as default Docker namespace. This is
controlled with the ``-n`` command line option. To push images to a Dockerhub
repository named ``mykollarepo``:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build -n mykollarepo --push

.. end

To push images to a `local registry
<https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/user/multinode.html#deploy-a-registry>`_,
use ``--registry`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build --registry 172.22.2.81:5000 --push

.. end

Build OpenStack from source
===========================

When building images, there are two methods of the OpenStack install. One is
``binary``. Another is ``source``. The ``binary`` means that OpenStack will be
installed from apt/yum. And the ``source`` means that OpenStack will be
installed from source code. The default method of the OpenStack install is
``binary``. It can be changed to ``source`` using the ``-t`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build -t source

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py -t source

.. end

The locations of OpenStack source code are written in
``etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf``.
Now the source type supports ``url``, ``git``, and ``local``. The location of
the ``local`` source type can point to either a directory containing the source
code or to a tarball of the source. The ``local`` source type permits to make
the best use of the Docker cache.

The ``etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` file looks like:

.. path etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [glance-base]
   type = url
   location = http://tarballs.openstack.org/glance/glance-master.tar.gz

   [keystone-base]
   type = git
   location = https://git.openstack.org/openstack/keystone
   reference = stable/mitaka

   [heat-base]
   type = local
   location = /home/kolla/src/heat

   [ironic-base]
   type = local
   location = /tmp/ironic.tar.gz

.. end

To build RHEL containers, it is necessary to include registration with RHN
of the container runtime operating system.To obtain a RHN
username/password/pool id, contact Red Hat. Use a template's header block
overrides file, add the following:

.. code-block:: console

   RUN subscription-manager register --user=<user-name> \
   --password=<password> && subscription-manager attach --pool <pool-id>

.. end

Dockerfile Customisation
========================

As of the Newton release, the ``kolla-build`` tool provides a Jinja2 based
mechanism which allows operators to customise the Dockerfiles used to generate
Kolla images.

This offers a lot of flexibility on how images are built, for example,
installing extra packages as part of the build, tweaking settings, installing
plugins, and numerous other capabilities. Some of these examples are described
in more detail below.

.. note::

   The docker file for each image is found in docker/<image name> directory.

Generic Customisation
---------------------

Anywhere the line ``{% block ... %}`` appears may be modified. The Kolla
community have added blocks throughout the Dockerfiles where we think they will
be useful, however, operators are free to submit more if the ones provided are
inadequate.

The following is an example of how an operator would modify the setup steps
within the Horizon Dockerfile.

First, create a file to contain the customisations, for example:
``template-overrides.j2``. In this place the following:

.. code-block:: console

   {% extends parent_template %}

   # Horizon
   {% block horizon_redhat_binary_setup %}
   RUN useradd --user-group myuser
   {% endblock %}

.. end

Then rebuild the horizon image, passing the ``--template-override`` argument:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build --template-override template-overrides.j2 horizon

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py --template-override template-overrides.j2 horizon

.. end

.. note::

   The above example will replace all contents from the original block. Hence
   in many cases one may want to copy the original contents of the block before
   making changes.

   More specific functionality such as removing/appending entries is available
   for packages, described in the next section.

Package Customisation
---------------------

Packages installed as part of an image build can be overridden, appended to,
and deleted. Taking the Horizon example, the following packages are installed
as part of a binary install type build:

* ``openstack-dashboard``
* ``httpd``
* ``mod_wsgi``
* ``mod_ssl``
* ``gettext``

To add a package to this list, say, ``iproute``, first create a file,
for example, ``template-overrides.j2``. In this place the following:

.. code-block:: console

   {% extends parent_template %}

   # Horizon
   {% set horizon_packages_append = ['iproute'] %}

.. end

Then rebuild the horizon image, passing the ``--template-override`` argument:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build --template-override template-overrides.j2 horizon

.. end

* For development, run:

.. code-block:: console

    python tools/build.py --template-override template-overrides.j2 horizon

.. end

Alternatively ``template_override`` can be set in ``kolla-build.conf``.

The ``append`` suffix in the above example carries special significance. It
indicates the operation taken on the package list. The following is a complete
list of operations available:

override
    Replace the default packages with a custom list.

append
    Add a package to the default list.

remove
    Remove a package from the default list.

Using a different base image
----------------------------

Base-image can be specified by argument ``--base-image``. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-build --base-image registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel --base rhel

.. end

Plugin Functionality
--------------------

The Dockerfile customisation mechanism is also useful for adding/installing
plugins to services. An example of this is Neutron's third party L2 `drivers
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron#Plugins>`_.

The bottom of each Dockerfile contains two blocks, ``image_name_footer``, and
``footer``. The ``image_name_footer`` is intended for image specific
modifications, while the ``footer`` can be used to apply a common set of
modifications to every Dockerfile.

For example, to add the ``networking-cisco`` plugin to the ``neutron_server``
image, one may want to add the following to the ``template-override`` file:

.. code-block:: console

   {% extends parent_template %}

   {% block neutron_server_footer %}
   RUN git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/networking-cisco \
       && pip --no-cache-dir install networking-cisco
   {% endblock %}

.. end

Astute readers may notice there is one problem with this however. Assuming
nothing else in the Dockerfile changes for a period of time, the above ``RUN``
statement will be cached by Docker, meaning new commits added to the Git
repository may be missed on subsequent builds. To solve this the Kolla build
tool also supports cloning additional repositories at build time, which will be
automatically made available to the build, within an archive named
``plugins-archive``.

.. note::

   The following is available for source build types only.

To use this, add a section to ``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` in the following
format:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [<image>-plugin-<plugin-name>]

.. end

Where ``<image>`` is the image that the plugin should be installed into, and
``<plugin-name>`` is the chosen plugin identifier.

Continuing with the above example, add the following to
``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf``:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [neutron-server-plugin-networking-cisco]
   type = git
   location = https://git.openstack.org/openstack/networking-cisco
   reference = master

.. end

The build will clone the repository, resulting in the following archive
structure:

.. code-block:: console

   plugins-archive.tar
   |__ plugins
       |__networking-cisco

.. end

The template now becomes:

.. code-block:: console

   {% block neutron_server_footer %}
   ADD plugins-archive /
   pip --no-cache-dir install /plugins/*
   {% endblock %}

.. end

Many of the Dockerfiles already copy the ``plugins-archive`` to the image and
install available plugins at build time.

Additions Functionality
-----------------------

The Dockerfile customisation mechanism is also useful for adding/installing
additions into images. An example of this is adding your jenkins job build
metadata (say formatted into a jenkins.json file) into the image.

Similarly to the plugins mechanism, the Kolla build tool also supports cloning
additional repositories at build time, which will be automatically made
available to the build, within an archive named ``additions-archive``. The main
difference between ``plugins-archive`` and ``additions-archive`` is that
``plugins-archive`` is copied to the relevant images and processed to install
available plugins while ``additions-archive`` processing is left to the Kolla
user.

.. note::

   The following is available for source build types only.

To use this, add a section to ``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` in the following
format:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [<image>-additions-<additions-name>]

.. end

Where ``<image>`` is the image that the plugin should be installed into, and
``<additions-name>`` is the chosen additions identifier.

Continuing with the above example, add the following to
``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` file:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   [neutron-server-additions-jenkins]
   type = local
   location = /path/to/your/jenkins/data

.. end

The build will copy the directory, resulting in the following archive
structure:

.. code-block:: console

   additions-archive.tar
   |__ additions
       |__jenkins

.. end

Alternatively, it is also possible to create an ``additions-archive.tar`` file
yourself without passing by ``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf`` in order to use the
feature for binary build type.

The template now becomes:

.. code-block:: console

   {% block neutron_server_footer %}
   ADD additions-archive /
   RUN cp /additions/jenkins/jenkins.json /jenkins.json
   {% endblock %}

.. end

Custom Repos
------------

Red Hat
-------
The build method allows the operator to build containers from custom repos.
The repos are accepted as a list of comma separated values and can be in the
form of ``.repo``, ``.rpm``, or a url. See examples below.

Update ``rpm_setup_config`` in ``/etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf``:

.. path /etc/kolla/kolla-build.conf
.. code-block:: ini

   rpm_setup_config = https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/currrent/delorean.repo,https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/delorean-deps.repo

.. end

If specifying a ``.repo`` file, each ``.repo`` file will need to exist in the
same directory as the base Dockerfile (``kolla/docker/base``):

.. path kolla/docker/base
.. code-block:: ini

   rpm_setup_config = epel.repo,delorean.repo,delorean-deps.repo

.. end

Ubuntu
------
For Debian based images, additional apt sources may be added to the build as
follows:

.. code-block:: ini

   apt_sources_list = custom.list

.. end

Known issues
============

#. Can't build base image because Docker fails to install systemd or httpd.

   There are some issues between Docker and AUFS. The simple workaround to
   avoid the issue is that add ``-s devicemapper`` or ``-s btrfs`` to
   ``DOCKER_OPTS``. Get more information about `the issue from the Docker bug
   tracker <https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6980>`_ and `how to
   configure Docker with BTRFS back end <https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/btrfs-driver/#prerequisites>`_.

#. Mirrors are unreliable.

   Some of the mirrors Kolla uses can be unreliable. As a result occasionally
   some containers fail to build. To rectify build problems, the build tool
   will automatically attempt three retries of a build operation if the first
   one fails. The retry count is modified with the ``--retries`` option.

Kolla-ansible with Local Registry
---------------------------------

To make kolla-ansible pull images from a local registry, set
``"docker_registry"`` to ``"172.22.2.81:5000"`` in
``"/etc/kolla/globals.yml"``. Make sure Docker is allowed to pull images from
insecure registry. See
`Docker Insecure Registry
<https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/user/multinode.html#deploy-a-registry>`_.

Building behind a proxy
-----------------------

We can insert http_proxy settings into the images to
fetch packages during build, and then unset them at the end to avoid having
them carry through to the environment of the final images. Note however, it's
not possible to drop the info completely using this method; it will still be
visible in the layers of the image.

To set the proxy settings, we can add this to the template's header block:

.. code-block:: ini

   ENV http_proxy=https://evil.corp.proxy:80
   ENV https_proxy=https://evil.corp.proxy:80

.. end

To unset the proxy settings, we can add this to the template's footer block:

.. code-block:: ini

   ENV http_proxy=""
   ENV https_proxy=""

.. end

Besides this configuration options, the script will automatically read these
environment variables. If the host system proxy parameters match the ones
going to be used, no other input parameters will be needed. These are the
variables that will be picked up from the user env:

.. code-block:: ini

   HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, FTP_PROXY,
   ftp_proxy, NO_PROXY, no_proxy

.. end

Also these variables could be overwritten using ``--build-args``, which have
precedence.
