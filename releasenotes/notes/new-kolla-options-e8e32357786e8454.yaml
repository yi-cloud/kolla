features:
  - |
    Adds an `--enable-unbuildable` option to ignore the internal list of
    unbuildable images. It is useful in two situations: building for a new
    distribution/architecture or generation of templates (with
    ``--templates-only`` option) when all templates are needed no matter being
    buildable or not.

upgrade:
  - |
    The way of generating templates (with ``--templates-only`` option) is
    changed.  By default only buildable ones are generated. If all templates
    are needed then ``--enable-unbuildable`` option must be used.
