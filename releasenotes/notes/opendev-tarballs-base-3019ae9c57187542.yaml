    Changes the default value of the ``[DEFAULT] tarballs_base`` configuration
    option from ``https://tarballs.openstack.org`` to
    ``https://tarballs.opendev.org``. Since the OpenDev site is namespaced, the
    default source image tarball locations have been updated to include the
    ``/openstack`` (or in a few cases ``/x``) URL path.
