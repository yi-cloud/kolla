    CentOS now uses upstream MariaDB repos (thus following the images
    of the other two distros). This is done to simplify MariaDB version
    management on Kolla side.
    The chosen version is synced with Debian and Ubuntu to 10.5.
    Operators may want to reflect this in their repo mirrors and
    proxies.
