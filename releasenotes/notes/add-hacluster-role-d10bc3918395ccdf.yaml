    Adds HAcluster images. These images contain services supporting High
    Availability such as Corosync, Pacemaker, Pacemaker Remote and PCS.

    HAcluster will not handle any OpenStack control plane resources, it
    will be used as third party for OpenStack Masakari for example to handle
    instance failover following a Nova compute crash.
