    Fixes an issue with the ``--skip-existing`` and ``--skip-parents`` flags
    which could cause images to not build. `LP#1867614
    <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1867614>`__.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changes the behaviour of the ``--skip-existing`` and ``--skip-parents``
    flags. Previously these were not applied if no regular expression or
    profile argument was provided to ``kolla-build``, but now they are.
