upgrade:

    Updates the default image type to ``source``. Users wishing to build
    ``binary`` type images should either specify the ``--type binary`` CLI
    argument or set ``[DEFAULT] type=binary`` in ``kolla-build.conf``.
    This change is to reflect the reality that source images are tested more
    thoroughly and we (as OpenStack community) have better control over them.
