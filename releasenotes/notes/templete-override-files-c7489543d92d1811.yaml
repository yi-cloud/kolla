    In the Ocata cycle, two new template-override subdirectories were added
    to contrib and doc directory. template override files stored in the
    contrib/template-override directory will not be gated and serve as an
    example of how to extend in-tree container images for specific use cases
    e.g. source build of infrastructure containers.
    Templates stored in contrib/template-override should have to correspond
    documentation in doc/template-override to describe their use.
