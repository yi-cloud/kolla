    Adds a ``distro_package_manager`` configuration option that can be used to
    specify which package manager commands should be used for a given operating
    system. The default value is ``dnf`` for RHEL 8 or Fedora, ``yum`` for
    other RHEL-based systems, or ``apt`` for Debian-based systems.
