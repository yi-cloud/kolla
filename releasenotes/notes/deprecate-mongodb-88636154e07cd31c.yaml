    Deprecates support for MongoDB image. In Victoria support for
    MongoDB image will be removed from Kolla. Note CentOS 8
    already lost support for MongoDB due to decisions made upstream.

    The only known downstream, Kolla Ansible, is deprecating and
    removing support for deploying MongoDB.

    MongoDB lost its position in OpenStack environment after
    controversial relicensing under their custom SSPL (Server Side
    Public License) which did not pass OSI (Open Source Initiative)
    validation.
