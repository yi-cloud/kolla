      Three Neutron plugins are no longer provided by default in
      images:
      ``networking-ansible``, ``networking-mlnx`` and ``vmware-nsx``.
      The main reason is that they lag in synchronising with OpenStack
      release process.
      Their definitions have been moved to ``contrib/neutron-plugins``
      directory.
      Please read the included ``README.rst`` in case you depend on
      them.
      Please note they are no longer included in published images.
