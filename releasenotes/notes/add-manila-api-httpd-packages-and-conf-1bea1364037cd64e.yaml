    The manila-api dockerfile now contains support for httpd and mod_wsgi
    packages for all supported platforms. It also contains the mod_ssl
    package for RHEL/centos and oraclelinux. Docker entrypoints can now use
    the httpd configuration seeded to run the manila-api service with
    httpd/mod_wsgi.
