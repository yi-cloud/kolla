features:
  - Static uid and gid are now set in container images.
    This ensures the numbers do not change and mess up
    upgrades from one image to another. These values are
    customizable in the kolla-build.conf if someone
    should wish to change the default values. By default,
    the uid and gid are set to 42400+, with the exception
    of Ceph, which is set to the static 64045 which
    matches the static uid that the package already uses.
