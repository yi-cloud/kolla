    Adds support for the Sahara plugins, which are provided separately from the
    core since the Stein release. The currently supported methods are source
    (through the ``sahara_base_packages`` variable) and RPM (through the
    dedicated ``sahara_base_plugins_pip_packages``.)
issues:
  - |
    Sahara plugins are no longer provided in Ubuntu binary images, since they
    were not packaged by the distribution in time for the Kolla Stein release.
