    Adds a new ``[DEFAULT] allowed-to-fail`` configuration option. It can be
    used to define a list of images which are allowed to fail during builds
    without marking the whole build as failed.

    The main use of this option is to keep CI systems in a working state
    despite some less important images failing.
