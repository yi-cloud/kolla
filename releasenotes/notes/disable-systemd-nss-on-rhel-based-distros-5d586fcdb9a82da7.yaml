    Drop systemd support from nsswitch.conf on RHEL-based distros. This avoids
    unneeded systemd nss lookups inside containers and it also avoids possible
    selinux denials when a container bind mounts /run and makes the dbus socket
    available inside the container only to be denied by selinux on the host.
