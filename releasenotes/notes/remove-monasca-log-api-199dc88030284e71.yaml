upgrade:
  - |
    The Monasca Log API merged into the Monasca API codebase in the Train
    release and the ``monasca-log-api`` image has therefore been removed.
  - |
    As part of the support for using the unified Monasca API for logs, the
    Fluentd Monasca output plugin has been upgraded. Any custom Fluentd
    configuration which forwards logs to Monasca will need to be updated.
