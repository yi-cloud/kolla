    Add networking-baremetal components: The ``baremetal`` ML2 mechanism driver
    and the ``ironic-neutron-agent`` L2 agent.

    Networking Baremetal provides deep integration between the Networking
    service and the Bare Metal service. Advanced networking features like
    notifications of port status changes and routed networks support in clouds
    with Bare Metal service.

    The ML2 mechanism driver is installed in the neutron-base image when
    building from source. Binary users can use
    ``neutron_server_packages_append`` to include the
    ``python-networking-baremetal`` package when building neutron-server image.
    The ``ironic-neutron-agent`` L2 agent is in the ``ironic-neutron-agent``
    image.
